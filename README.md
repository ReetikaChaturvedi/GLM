# GLM
Implemented a basic image recognition system using logistic regression
We were given a dataset that contained instances of 10 digits available (0-9) and were asked to train and test ten different logistic regression models. Two datasets were provided (training and test data) that contained grayscale images. There were 785 columns in the dataset. The first column represented the digit labels (0-9) and the remaining columns represented pixel values of the image.
